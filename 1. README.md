This is my Github repository!
There are 4 (four) original dataset collected from different government websites. Since the original datasets had additional information that was not necessary for this project, I eliminated them and selected only the data for the running codes.
The files are named respectively:
  1. Total_EVS.xlxs
  2. alt_fuel_stations (Jun 30 2024).csv
  3. electricity_data.xlsx
  4. fuel_data.xlsx
The above files will be processed and finally, summarized into a file named: "Final Table merged_df_new.xlsx".

All data processing is subject to ethical considerations and explained in detail in the report.
